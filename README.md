# Sea-cucumber-authenticity

This repository was created to upload the data that support the findings of the paper "A screening of tools to differentiate wild vs. farmed sea cucumbers in multi-trophic aquaculture systems with no artificial feed inputs" by David et al. (2026).

It consists of four tables (Compositions of amino acids, fatty acids, sterols and stable isotope ratios).

Id refers to an individual identifier for sea cucumbers. Sea cucumbers notation are in the form HF_FYY_ZZZ where HF stands for body wall of Holothuria forskali, F (or M or Unknown) for sex, XX for the number of individual and ZZZ for the location where the individual was found.

SplBatch refers to the batch identifier as reported in Table 1.

SplMass refers to the weight of sample that was used to conduct the analysis.

Origin refers to the provenance of the sample, born in the wild or born in captivity.

Group refers to a more precise grouping of the origin of the sample, wild, captured and caged or born in captivity.

SamplingDate refers to the date at which the individual was sacrificed.

Fatty acids are reported as the area of the FID signal correponding to each fatty acid. Fatty acids are annotated in the form Ca.bwc where a refers to the number of carbons, b to the number of double bounds and c to the position of the first double bound from the end of chain.

StdC23 (only in the fatty acids table) refers to the amount of C23 standard added to the sample (in ug).

Amino acids are reported as percentage of all amino acids in the samples.

PrProt (only in the amino acids table) corresponds to the percentage of proteins in the samples.

Sterols are reported as the area of the FID signal correponding to each sterol. 

StdStig (only in the sterols table) refers to the amount of stigmasterol standard added to the sample (in ug).

Stable isotopes are reported relative to authentic standards.
