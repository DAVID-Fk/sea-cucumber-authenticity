# Sea-cucumber-authenticity

This repository was created to upload the data that support the findings of the paper "A screening of tools to differentiate wild vs. farmed sea cucumbers in multi-trophic aquaculture systems with no artificial feed inputs" by David et al. (2026).

It consists of four tables (Compositions of amino acids, fatty acids, sterols and stable isotope ratios).

Id refers to an individual identifier for sediments (Sed) or sea cucumbers. Sea cucumbers notation are in the form XX_FYY_ZZZ where XX stands for tissue type and species name (BF for body wall of Holothuria forskali, MF for muscle of Holothuria forskali, HT for body wall of Holothuria tubulosa and MT for muscle of Holothuria tubulosa), F (or M or Unknown) for sex, XX for the number of individual and ZZZ for the location where the individual was found.

splMass of Winitial / Wfinal refers to the weight of sample that was used to conduct the analysis.

Fatty acids are reported as the area of the FID signal correponding to each fatty acid. Fatty acid are annotated in the form Ca.bwc where a refers to the number of carbons, b to the number of double bounds and c to the position of the first double bound from the end of chain.

StdC23 (only in the fatty acid table) refers to the amount of C23 standard added to the sample (in ug).
Stable isotopes are reported relative to authentic standards.
